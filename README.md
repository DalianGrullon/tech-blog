## Description

[Deployed Application](https://tech-blog-dg.herokuapp.com/)

Tech Blog is a full-stack web application that allows users to create an account, comment on other blog posts, and create blog posts. I built this application as a fun way to practice my full-stack web development skills and bring to life a passion of mine which is blogging!

In creating Tech Blog, I designed the database architecture, server-side logic, and front-end styling which resulted in a lot of really good practice in architecting a full-stack project. I learned a lot about using MySQL to establish a relational database, Node and Express for server-side logic and API development, and Handlebars and Bootstrap for rendering data driven pages with style.

3. Once unzipped, ensure that MySQL is installed and hosting a live server

4. Open the `connection.js` file in the `config` directory and edit line 7 with your MySQL server information to ensure a proper connection. You can also create a `.env` file and include:

```
  DB_NAME = 'database name'
  DB_USER = 'Your username'
  DB_PASSWORD = 'Your password'
```

5. Run the `schema.sql` file in either DBeaver or via the command-line to initiate the database.

6. Run the following commands to  install all dependencies, seed the database, and start the application

```
npm install

npm run seed

npm start
```
